- On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives
- They're made of lipstic, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes
	- sable: [원래는 검은담비 라는 동물](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sable) 인데 '검정색'이라는 뜻으로 쓰인듯
- All your life all you've asked when's your daddy gonna talk to you
- You were living in another world tryin' to get your message through
- No one heard a single word you said
- They should have seen it in your eyes
- What was going around your head
- Ooh, she's a little runway
	- 그녀는 어린 가출소녀
- Daddy's girl learned fast
	- 그녀는 빨리 배우지
- All those things he couldn't say
	- 아빠가 말해주지 못하는 것들을
- Ooh, she's a little runaway
- A different line every night
	- [[tags/TODO]] 여기서의 `line`이 무슨 의미인지 모르겠다. 해석해 놓은 곳들도 제각각임
	- 일단 "매일 밤 다른 길이"로 하자
- Guranteed to blow your mind
	- 너를 흥분시키지
- I see you out on the street,
- Call me for a wild time
	- 힘들땐 나를 불러줘
- So, you sit home alone 'cause there's nothing left that you can do
- There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you
- You know she likes the lights at nights on the neon Broadway signs
- She don't readlly mind, it's only love she hoped to find
