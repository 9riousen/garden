작사/작곡: Axl Rose

- When I look into your eyes
- I can see a love [restrained](https://en.dict.naver.com/#/entry/enko/947f95ea26164c2488d834cd1558e349)
- But, darlin', when I hold you
- Don't you know I feel the same?
- Nothin' last forever
- And we both know hearts can change
- And it's hard to hold a candle
- In the cold November rain
- we've been through this such a long long time
- just tryin' to kill the pain
- But lovers always come and lovers always go
- And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
- walkin' away
- If we could take the time to lay it on the line
- I could rest my head
- just knowin' that you were mine
- All mine
- So, if you want to love me
- Then, darlin' don't refrain
- or I'll just end up walkin'
- In the cold November rain
- Do you need some time on your own?
- Do you need some time all alone?
- Everybody needs some time on their own
- Don't you know you need some time all alone
- I know it's hard to keep an open heart
- When even friends seem out to harm you
- But if you could heal a broken heart
- Wouldn't time be out to charm you
	- 이거 누가 해석 좀 (당신을 매혹시키기엔 시간이 모자르다는 뜻인가?) [[tags/TODO]]
- Sometimes, I need some time on my own
- Sometimes, I need some time all alone
- Everybody nedds some time on their own
- Don't you know you need some time all alone?
- And when your fears [[subside]]
- And shadows still remain
- I know that you can love me
- when there's no one left to blame
- so, never mine the darkness
- we still can find a way
- 'cause nothin' lasts forever
- even cold November rain
- Don't ya think that you need somebody?
- Everybody needs somebody
- You're not the only one
